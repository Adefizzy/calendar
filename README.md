# Front-end Javascript Challenge

## Description

This project is designed to test your knowledge of front-end web technologies and assess your ability to create front-â€‹end UI products with attention to details, cross-browser compatibility, standards, and  reusability.


## Assignment

The goal of this exercise is to create a demo calendar application using React.

You should start by rendering a single month view of a calendar for the current month, along the lines of the illustration below

## Mandatory features
 - Ability to add "*reminders*" (max. 30 characters) for a day and time specified by the user. Also, include a city.
 - Display reminders on the calendar view, in the correct time order.
 - Allow the user to select a color when creating a reminder, and display it appropriately.
 - Ability to edit reminders - including changing text, city, day, time and color.
 - Add a weather service call from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/forecast16) and get the weather forecast (e.g. Rain) for the date of the calendar reminder based on the city.
 - Unit test the functionality: *Ability to add "*reminders*" (max. 30 characters) for a day and time specified by the user. Also, include a city.*

## Bonus (Optional)

- Expand the calendar to support more than the current month or year.
- Properly handle overflow when multiple reminders appear on the same date.
- Include the ability to delete one or all the reminders for a specific day.

## Considerations

 - The project is completely focused on Front-end. Ignore the Back-end.
 - Feel free to use small helper libraries for:
 -- UI Elements.
 -- Date/Time handling.
 - **You must create the calendar component yourself**. Do not user calendar libraries like FullCalendar or Bootstrap Calendar.
 - Provide working API keys to any external API you use.
 - Show us your capabilities on CSS and styling, if possible.
